        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
        background, expertise, accomplishments or standing</p>

          the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
          minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
          assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
          whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
          from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
          field may be required to play all their games away.</dd>
